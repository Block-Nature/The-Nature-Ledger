# 🌿 THE NATURE LEDGER 🌿
**Architect:** Mike SALADIN  
**Status:** Operational Protocol / Active Simulation  
**Reference:** Block-Nature Project

## 👁️ VISION
"Nature is no longer a sanctuary; it is data. **The Nature Ledger** is the ultimate interface where every organic fragment is converted into binary value." 

This project explores the tension between biological origin and algorithmic synthesis. As a validator, your role is to confirm the consensus of reality between carbon and code.

## 🗳️ VOTING PROTOCOL
The system relies on a cycle of **3 VOTES** crucial for stabilizing the simulation:

1.  **GENERATE ($BLOCK):** To interact, you must first generate your tokens via the `[MINT +10]` button.
2.  **CHOOSE (3 VOTES):** Browse the gallery. You must submit exactly **3 VOTES** on the works that resonate with your perception to saturate the data register.
3.  **TRANSITION (MATRIX JUMP):** Once the third **VOTE** is confirmed, the system initiates an `UPLOADING` sequence. You will be propelled into the **Autonomous Void**, a **15-second** zone where AI takes total control before revealing the Architect's identity via the final terminal.
